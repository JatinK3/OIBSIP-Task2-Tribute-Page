            <h2>About Cristiano Ronaldo</h2>
            <p>
                Cristiano Ronaldo, one of the greatest footballers of all time, was born on February 5, 1985, in Madeira, Portugal. From humble beginnings, he rose to the very top of the football world. Known for his incredible work ethic, athleticism, and dedication, Ronaldo's career is marked by numerous records, awards, and accolades.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a career spanning clubs like Sporting CP, Manchester United, Real Madrid, Juventus, and Al-Nassr, Ronaldo has consistently proven himself on the global stage. His legacy extends beyond football, as he inspires millions with his determination, perseverance, and leadership.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ronaldo's success is not just limited to his individual awards like multiple Ballon d'Ors, but also in leading his teams to victory in numerous championships, including UEFA Champions League titles, domestic league titles, and a Euro Championship with Portugal.

                Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million). He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to the team winning four Champions Leagues from 2014 to 2018, including La Décima. During this period, he won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival.
                He also became the club's all-time top goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished as the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, two UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups.

                Ronaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has earned more than 200 caps, making him history's most-capped male player.
                With 130 international goals, he is also the all-time top male goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in eleven major tournaments and scored in ten; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004,
                where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008. 
                In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. 
                The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. 
                This achievement would see him receive his fourth Ballon d'Or. He also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals, and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020. 
                The same tournament, he broke the record of most international goals scored in men's football and became the player with the most international caps in men's football in 2023.
                One of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2016, 2017, and 2023, and the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019.
                Time included him on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. Ronaldo is most popular sportsperson on social media, he counts over 1 billion total followers across Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram, making him the first person to achieve that feat.
                In 2020, Ronaldo was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team and he is the first footballer and the third sportsman to earn US$1 billion in his career.
